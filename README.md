|Series| STRANGER THINGS|
|Stranger Things is ultimately a study in love and relationships in all their messy brokenness, and an exploration of the things that make us human and differentiate us from the forces of evil, portrayed in the series as coming from a Dantesque place of utter coldness. When a young boy vanishes, a small town uncovers a mystery involving secret experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one strange little girl. Watch all you want. This nostalgic nod to '80s sci-fi and horror classics has earned dozens of Emmy nominations, including three for Outstanding Drama.|
